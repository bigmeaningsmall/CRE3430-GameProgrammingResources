### Physics: OnCollisionExit

The `OnCollisionExit` method in Unity is triggered when a collider stops touching another collider. Like `OnCollisionEnter`, this is used for physics-based collision handling, but it responds to the moment the collision ends. It's useful for detecting when objects separate, such as when a player steps off a platform or an object moves out of a certain zone.

To use `OnCollisionExit`, at least one of the GameObjects must have a `Rigidbody` component, and both must have colliders.

#### Example: Detecting When Objects Stop Colliding

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class CollisionExitExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    // This method is called when this GameObject stops colliding with another GameObject
    private void OnCollisionExit(Collision collision)
    {
        // Log the name of the GameObject we stopped colliding with
        Debug.Log("Stopped colliding with: " + collision.gameObject.name);

        // Example: Trigger behavior when an enemy leaves the player's collision
        if (collision.gameObject.tag == "Enemy")
        {
            Debug.Log("Enemy left the collision area!");
            // Example: Restore player's speed or deactivate effects
        }
    }
}
```

#### Key Components of `OnCollisionExit`:

1. **Collision Parameter**: Like `OnCollisionEnter`, the `Collision` object provides information about the collision that just ended:
   - `collision.gameObject`: The GameObject we stopped colliding with.
   - `collision.relativeVelocity`: The relative speed at which the GameObjects were moving apart.

2. **Tag-Based Detection**: You can use `collision.gameObject.tag` to check for specific objects that left the collision, which is useful for determining when specific interactions end (e.g., a player leaving a danger zone or an enemy disengaging).

3. **Rigidbody Requirement**: At least one of the GameObjects involved must have a `Rigidbody` component for `OnCollisionExit` to trigger.

4. **Collider Requirement**: Both GameObjects need colliders to detect when they separate.

#### Example: Player Leaving a Platform

You can create specific behavior for when a player leaves a platform or exits a zone:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerExit : MonoBehaviour
{
    private bool isOnPlatform = false;

    private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
    {
        if (collision.gameObject.tag == "Platform")
        {
            isOnPlatform = true;
            Debug.Log("Player is on the platform");
        }
    }

    private void OnCollisionExit(Collision collision)
    {
        if (collision.gameObject.tag == "Platform")
        {
            isOnPlatform = false;
            Debug.Log("Player left the platform");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Example: Triggering an Action When Leaving a Zone

You can also trigger actions when a player or object exits a specific area:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class ZoneExit : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void OnCollisionExit(Collision collision)
    {
        if (collision.gameObject.tag == "Zone")
        {
            Debug.Log("Left the danger zone!");

            // Example: Trigger events, restore health, or modify game state
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points

- **OnCollisionExit** is called when two colliders stop touching, at least one of which has a `Rigidbody`.
- You can use the `Collision` object to get information about the GameObject that left the collision.
- Use tags to check the type of object that exited the collision, and trigger appropriate game logic.
- This method is useful for behaviors that depend on objects leaving certain areas or interactions.

This method complements `OnCollisionEnter` by handling the end of physical interactions between GameObjects in Unity.
