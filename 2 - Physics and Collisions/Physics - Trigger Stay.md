### Physics: OnTriggerStay

The `OnTriggerStay` method in Unity is called once per frame while a GameObject is within a trigger collider. This is useful for detecting when an object stays inside a specific area and applying continuous effects, such as healing, damage over time, or ongoing interactions like staying in a zone to capture an objective.

For `OnTriggerStay` to work, one of the colliding objects must have a `Collider` marked as **Trigger**, and at least one of the objects must have a `Rigidbody`.

#### Example: Detecting Ongoing Interaction Within a Trigger

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class TriggerStayExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    // This method is called every frame while this GameObject stays within a trigger collider
    private void OnTriggerStay(Collider other)
    {
        // Log the name of the object staying inside the trigger zone
        Debug.Log(other.gameObject.name + " is still inside the trigger!");

        // Example: Continuously apply an effect to the player while inside the trigger
        if (other.gameObject.tag == "Player")
        {
            Debug.Log("Player is in the healing zone!");
            // Example: Continuously heal the player
        }
    }
}
```

#### Key Components of `OnTriggerStay`:

1. **Collider Parameter**: The `Collider` object represents the GameObject that remains inside the trigger zone:
   - `other.gameObject`: The GameObject that is still in the trigger zone.
   - `other.transform.position`: The position of the object remaining inside the zone.

2. **Tag-Based Detection**: Using `other.gameObject.tag`, you can apply specific behaviors to certain objects while they stay within the trigger (e.g., healing a player while they remain in a healing zone).

3. **Trigger Requirement**: The collider must have the **Is Trigger** option enabled for this method to work.

4. **Rigidbody Requirement**: One of the objects (either the trigger or the object inside) must have a `Rigidbody`.

#### Example: Applying Continuous Healing

This example heals the player as long as they remain inside the trigger zone:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class HealingZone : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float healingRate = 5f;

    private void OnTriggerStay(Collider other)
    {
        if (other.gameObject.tag == "Player")
        {
            // Apply healing over time while the player remains in the zone
            float healing = healingRate * Time.deltaTime;
            Debug.Log("Healing player by " + healing + " per second.");
            // Example: Increase player's health
        }
    }
}
```

#### Example: Staying in a Danger Zone

You can also detect when a player remains inside a danger zone, applying continuous damage:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class DamageZone : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float damagePerSecond = 10f;

    private void OnTriggerStay(Collider other)
    {
        if (other.gameObject.tag == "Player")
        {
            // Apply damage over time while the player stays in the danger zone
            float damage = damagePerSecond * Time.deltaTime;
            Debug.Log("Player is taking " + damage + " damage per second in the danger zone.");
            // Example: Reduce player's health
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points

- **OnTriggerStay** is called once per frame while an object remains inside a trigger collider.
- The object inside the trigger zone is passed as the `Collider` parameter (`other`).
- To use this method, one collider must have **Is Trigger** enabled, and one of the objects must have a `Rigidbody`.
- This method is useful for applying continuous effects, such as healing, damage over time, or maintaining game logic (e.g., capturing a point or interacting with an object).
- Use tags to apply specific behaviours to different objects while they stay inside the trigger.
